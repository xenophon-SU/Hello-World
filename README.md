# Hello-World
Developer 
Hey everyone, I'm new to the development community. I'm not sure what direction I want to take or if I'll be any good at this, but I am eager to learn is all I know. I've been playing around with Kali Linux for the last year and unfortunately I still know next to nothing. I've ruined a couple of systems of mine which has led me here. I really want to learn from some people who know what they're doing instead of continuing to mess things up trying to do stuff blindly.
